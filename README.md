# ‚ú® Howdy! My name is Sofa, and here I store projects that I create in my free time, whenever I have it 
Currently I work in a software-development field and develop .NET applications and WebAPIs.

I want to dive deeper into software development and learn more about web development:
- I want to get better at utilizing my current stack of technologies;
- Learn new frameworks and tools to make better apps;
- Continue to improve the way I write code;
- Get to work on meaningful and interesting projects, that allow me to fully utilize my potential.
